# Team Fortress 2 Dodgeball Maps

This repo contains the original files of my 5 tfdb maps, and the code for the FewGoodMen script.

You can find the compiled artifacts under [Releases](https://github.com/maor-rosenfeld/tfdb/releases).

## FewGoodMen

The FewGoodMen plugin is an auto-balancing mode that mostly makes sense in Dodgeball.

When a round ends, the plugin will move the weakest player from the winning team to the losing team. If the winning team keeps winning, eventually it will only have a single player fighting everyone else in the server. The lone wolf would stay by himself as long as he/she keeps winning.
